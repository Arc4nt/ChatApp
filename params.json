  "body": "### What is it?\r\nChatapp is a single page application of a real time chat. ChatApp contains the basic features of existing chats such as add and delete contacts, create groups, add and remove users to the groups, know when a contact is connected and also allows to send scribbles.\r\n\r\n### Technologies used:\r\nThis application was created using different technologies such as: **Angularjs**, **Angular Materials**, **WebSockets**, **Ajax**, **HTML5** and **CSS3** for the front-end. \r\nWhereas in the back-end technologies as: **Nodejs**, **express**, **socketIO**, **mongodb**, **promises**, and several middle-ware as cookie and body parser.\r\n\r\n### Why NodeJS and socketIO?\r\nThe application server uses NodeJS and socketIO to stablish a live conection with the clients. This way  when a client is sending them a message, the destination clients are able to receive the notifications from the server. Also in the worst case scenario, if the client is not compatible with websockets, it would fallback to ajax polling keeping the funcionality of the application.\r\n\r\n### Previews\r\nAdding contacts\r\n![adding contacts](https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-12/14859430_10157544263200567_345999191_o.png?oh=9017adae9d015390217b2ef3295f51a4&oe=5813DC0C)\r\nAccepting or declining friend requests\r\n![contact request](https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-12/14881259_10157544263255567_1913647407_o.png?oh=42c008563e891c75e344863549466507&oe=581358A4)\r\nSending messages and know when they are connected\r\n![msg contacts](https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-12/14894491_10157544263235567_1285283674_o.png?oh=158c4b1c3317db1b6cbfc358f883530f&oe=5813A8ED)\r\nCreating groups and send scribles\r\n![groups and scribles](https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-12/14895542_10157544263225567_1655178400_o.png?oh=0097cf9be91cc805266ddca45af5a901&oe=5813C9B3)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
