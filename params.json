ChatApp contains the basic features of existing chats such as add and delete contacts, create groups, add and remove users to the groups, know when a contact is connected and also allows to send scribbles.\r\n\r\n### Technologies used:\r\nThis application was created using different technologies such as: Angularjs, Angular Materials, WebSockets, Ajax, HTML5 and CSS3 for the front-end. \r\nWhereas in the back-end technologies as: Nodejs, express, socketIO mongodb, and several middle-ware as cookie and body parser.\r\n\r\n### Why NodeJS and socketIO?\r\nNodeJS has been coming up recently and can provide a pretty good response without the necessity of expensive hardware, and taking advantage of websockets and socketIO a live connection can be created to enable the server sending packages to the clients without the necessity that the client ask for it before. \r\nAlso in the worst case scenario, if the client cant handle websockets it would fallback to polling.\r\n\r\n![groups and scribles](https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-12/14895542_10157544263225567_1655178400_o.png?oh=0097cf9be91cc805266ddca45af5a901&oe=5813C9B3)\r\n\r\n",
